# Main scripts description
* archetype_database.py --> generate 3D matrics of DL4LD archetypes of given dimension
* input_matrix_generator.py --> input 3D matrics that describes a collobaoration request
* distance_calculaton.py --> compute the distances between two collaboration models
* precion_calculation.py --> compute the proposed metric precision
* extensibility.py --> compute the proposed metric extensibility
* Coverage_calculation.py --> compute the proposed metric coverage
* selection_algorithm.py --> emulate the intelligent infrastruture selecion procedure described in Alg. 2.2
